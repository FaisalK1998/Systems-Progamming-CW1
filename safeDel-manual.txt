NAME
       safeDel - A Bash Script Utility For Better File Deletion


SYNOPSIS
       safeDel.sh [-l] [-r] [-d] [-t] [-m] [-k]


DESCRIPTION
       safeDel	must  automatically create the users trash can directory if it
       does not already exist. safeDel will be both command  line  driven  and
       menu  driven.  safeDel will display a menu to the user only if the user
       provides no command line options or arguments. The  functionality  made
       available  to a user using command line options or the menu will be the
       same.


OPTIONS
       The command line options available will be:

       [-l] - Outputs a list on screen of the  trashCan  directory  with  file
       name, size and file type

       [-r]  -	Recover,  will	get  a	specified file taken from the trashCan
       directory and places it in the current working directory

       [-d] - Delete, removes the file selected by the user. The user will  be
       asked for each file in turn

       [-t]  -	Total,	displays  the total usage of the trashCan directory in
       bytes

       [-w] - Monitor, starts the monitor script which opens in a new terminal
       window. This will monitor the creation, change and deletion of files in
       the directory and update it every 15 seconds

       [-k] - Kill, terminates the monitor script process
